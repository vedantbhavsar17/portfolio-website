					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Everyone has that one spark a moment, a question, or a curiosity that leads them onto a completely new path. For me, that path was machine learning. I'm still a beginner, still learning, still figuring it out, but here's how it all began and why I'm sticking with it.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>My Background: Where It All Began</h2>
					<br>
					<p>I’m currently pursuing BCA in Web Development at SDJ International College in Surat. From the very start of my course, I found myself drawn toward coding. Even before college began, I was learning C++ on my own. That early exposure gave me a head start and ignited my curiosity to go deeper into the world of programming.
					<br><br>
					Once college started, I got introduced to C programming, and that helped me build a strong foundation. Around the same time, I began learning HTML and CSS through YouTube. I even created a simple demo site modeled after Amazon — just to test what I could build with my own hands. These small wins kept me excited. But then, I came across something even more fascinating.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>How I Got Curious About Machine Learning</h2>
					<br>
					<p>While exploring tech content online, I started experimenting with various AI tools like OpenAI and Gemini etc. Watching how these tools understood and responded like humans. I kept asking myself:
					<br><br>
					How are they doing this? What’s going on behind the scenes?
					<br><br>
					That led me down the rabbit hole of research, where I discovered terms like machine learning (ML), AI, and natural language processing (NLP). The more I learned, the more curious I became. I wanted to understand how machines learn, how models are trained, and how data drives everything.
					<br>
					I found a few really good YouTube channels especially CampusX, whose DSMP (Data Science Mentorship Program) gave me a proper roadmap. That was the real beginning of my ML journey.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Why I Chose Machine Learning</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Initially, I was afraid of the math involved in ML. I didn’t think I could handle it. But when I started practicing solving problems and learning concepts my confidence started growing. I realized that math isn’t the enemy it’s the language of machine learning.
					<br><br>
					As I went deeper, I fell in love with concepts like:
					<br><br>
					<ul type="circle">
						<li>Hypothesis testing</li>
						<li>Probability</li>
						<li>PDF & PMF</li>
					</ul>
					<ul type="circle">
						<li>Data distributions</li>
						<li>Vectors & Tensors</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>Today, math is actually my favorite subject. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas and truly understanding them not just for marks or exams, but to build something meaningful.</p>
					<br><br>
					<h2>My First Steps into ML Concepts</h2>
					<br>
  					<p>Before jumping into advanced ML, I focused on building my Python skills. I’m still learning Python now, and so far I’ve covered:</p>
  					<br>
  					<ul type="circle">
					    <li>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)</li>
					    <li>Loops and iterations</li>
					    <li>Generators (which are super useful in ML and DL)</li>
					    <li>NumPy and Pandas</li>
					 </ul>
					 <br>
  					<p>Understanding how these tools work is like preparing my toolkit for machine learning. I now realize that everything from data handling to model building rests on a solid understanding of these basics.</p>
  					<br>
  					<h2>Final Words: My ML Journey So Far</h2>
  					<br>
  					<p>For me, machine learning isn’t just a tech skill it’s a personal transformation. I started as someone unsure about math, and now I enjoy learning probability and statistics. I started as a web dev student, and now I’m dreaming in tensors and models.</p>
  					<br>
  					<p>If I had to describe my ML journey in one line, it would be:</p>
  					<br>
  					<blockquote>
   						"I’m not an expert - I’m just someone who chose to begin and never stopped learning."
  					</blockquote>
  					<br>
  					<p>And this journey?<br>
  					It’s only just getting started.</p>
